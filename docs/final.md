**Information Problem:** Finding a field to hold organized sporting events is difficult. Not only is it hard to find a well maintained field, but it is also frustrating arriving to a field that is already in use.

**Stakeholders:** 
- Athletes
- Active residents of Prince Georgeâ€™s county
- Intramural and club sports teams

**Data Source:** 
- We used a database that contains sufficient data that gives the user locations of fields within the Prince George County. 
- [Link to Data Source](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Community/Recreation-Centers/gwq4-iu9d) 

**Solution:**
Provide the public with information on recreational centers by creating an application utilizing the database information. 

**Rationale**

**How it helps:**
The application allows users to go through every possible rec center until they find one that is open and works for their activity.
