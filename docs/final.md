**Information Problem:** Finding a field to hold organized sporting events is difficult. Not only is it hard to find a well maintained field, but it is also frustrating arriving to a field that is already in use.

**Stakeholders:**
    - Athletes
    - Active residents of Prince Georgeâ€™s county
    - Intramural and club sports teams

**Data Source:** 
    - We used a database that contains sufficient data that gives the user locations of fields within the Prince George County.
