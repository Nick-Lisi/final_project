# RecMate
## INST377 

We are trying to solve the information problem of finding areas in PG County to have organized sports. Most sports can be played on the front lawn or in the backyard, however there are many times where a court/field is needed or people simply do not have enough space to conduct a game. Our application aims to help people in your community find open fields for all sports. We plan to bring the community together by streamlining the recreation center booking process.
